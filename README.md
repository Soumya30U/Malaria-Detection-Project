### 1. Introduction to Problem Statement
Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases. It is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.

However, Malaria diagnosis involves close examination of the blood smear at 100x magnification. This is followed by a manual counting process wherein experts count the number of Red blood cells impacted by parasites. Automatic detection of Malaria from blood smear image is a scalable solution and can save a lot of hours for healthcare industry going a long way in our battle against this deadly disease. In this project, we try to identify from blood smears using deep learning to predict whether the sample is taken from an infected person.
